# Technology/Remote Patient Monitoring - Acute Care
Project Focus
Our Project will be focusing on empowering Doctors/Nurses to keep track of and manage their patients proactively while minimizing contact whenever possible to reduce any potential chances of infection. This will focus on patients in ICU conditions however it can be applied to other patients as well (Any who are connected to vital-sign monitoring equipment). The project will leverage in-house monitoring equipment within the hospitals and the medicollector API to achieve this.
 
Doctors will have access dashboard showing their patients live updated symptoms/vital signs at a glance to enable them to treat more patients and keep up with demand in an increasingly overwhelmed healthcare system while also minimizing unnecessary contact.

The app has a built-in automated inventory reporting/alarm system, will let know the administrators if a supply is almost depleted with an email.

# Technology Overview
Our project will utilize a custom React front hitting a .NET core API as our backend stack. The data is going to be stored on a SQL DB hosted on Azure, the data can be visualized on a power bi dashboard embedded on the react.
 
The data acquisition from the bedside monitors is going to be through an API named Medicollector and the stream is going to add the streaming data on iothub on Azure that is also connected to a data analytics.
